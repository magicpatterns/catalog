# Create React App + Mirrorful Example

This is a [React](https://react.dev/) project bootstrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/) and [Mirrorful](https://mirrorful.com/) added.

⚠️ create-react-app may warn that you are trying to import from outside the src directory. We are working on a long-term solution, but for now, we would recommend making a copy of the `.mirrorful` folder in your src directory.

This example has a copy of the `.mirrorful` folder in the `src` directory.

## Run the development server:

```bash
cd examples/create-react-app
npm install
```

```bash
npm start
```

## Run Mirrorful

```bash
npx mirrorful editor
```

This will open a localhost editor at 5050.

Then copy paste the .mirrorful folder automatically created in root into the `src` directory.
