# Mirrorful + styled-components + Vite + React

This is a react app bootstrapped with styled-components and Mirrorful.

This project shows you how you can easily integrate Mirrorful into styled-components.

## Run the development server

```
npm install
```

```
npm run dev
```

This will open a website at: http://127.0.0.1:5173/

### Run Mirrorful

⚠️ This app will warn that you are trying to import from outside the src directory. We are working on a long-term solution, but for now, we would recommend making a copy of the .mirrorful folder in your `src` directory, as we have done in this example.

```
npx mirrorful editor
```

This will open a browser window with the Mirrorful at localhost:5050.
