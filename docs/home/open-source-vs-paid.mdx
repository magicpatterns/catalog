We're currently focused on developing non-enterprise offerings first that should suit most use-cases.

We are working hard to make Mirrorful more extensive. Need any integrations or want a new feature? Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/Mirrorful/mirrorful/issues) or contribute directly to the repository. (_The first draft of this README was made by a contributor!_)
