</Info>

Mirrorful has a `web` app and `server` project. Mirrorful's core logic lives in `packages/core`.

After cloing the repo, we can install all dependencies and run the web app:

```bash
# In project root
cd apps/web; yarn; yarn dev;
```

Before running the server, in a seperate terminal window, you'll need to install `mongodb` and run it in the background:

```bash
# In project root
cd packages/server; brew tap mongodb/brew; brew install mongodb-community@6.0; mongod --dbpath ./db/data
```

Finally, in a separate terminal window, run the Mirrorful server:

```bash
# In project root
cd packages/server; yarn; yarn dev;
```
