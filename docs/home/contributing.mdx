Not sure where to get started? You can:

- [Book a free, non-pressure pairing sessions with one of our teammates](https://usemotion.com/meet/teddyni/meet?d=15!)

- Join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/mirrorful/shared_invite/zt-1ps2xtxh0-2NaixFfFzSKZbr5gw_AHfA) and ask us any questions there.

No matter the PR, all the Github avatars of contributors will be added to the Mirrorful README with their permission.

## Running Mirrorful Locally

Mirrorful runs as a set of packages in a monorepo in order to share common logic across multiple channels.

Mirrorful's core logic lives in `packages/core`. This logic is then consumed in our NPM package, located in `packages/mirrorful`.

First, we will need to build Mirrorful's core library, `@mirrorful/core`. In `packages/core`, run:

```
// Install packages
yarn

// Tell Yarn to reference this local build instead of the published package
yarn link

// Build and hot reload the core library
yarn build:watch
```

Now, we can run Mirrorful as a package. In `packages/mirrorful/editor`, run:

```
// Install packages
yarn

// Tell Yarn to reference the local build instead of the published package
yarn link @mirrorful/core

// Run Mirrorful
yarn dev
```
