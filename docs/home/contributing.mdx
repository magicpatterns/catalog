Not sure where to get started? You can:

- [Book a free, non-pressure pairing sessions with one of our teammates](https://usemotion.com/meet/teddyni/meet?d=15!)

- Join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/mirrorful/shared_invite/zt-1ps2xtxh0-2NaixFfFzSKZbr5gw_AHfA) and ask us any questions there.

No matter the PR, all the Github avatars of contributors will be added to the Mirrorful README with their permission.
