And more...

## 🎨 Why should I use Mirrorful?

Design systems are the building blocks of your app, but many projects don't adopt them until it's too late because they are hard to set up correctly. Mirrorful gets you set up for a basic design system in minutes while leaving flexibility down the line for customizations. It's lightweight and dead simple.

We're on a mission to help your project be as beautiful as possible. The bar for high-quality design is getting higher. We want to help everyone add simple design tokens to new (and existing!) projects.

Simple design systems also speed up development — even early-stage projects! One report suggests it's 47% faster to build a simple form using a design system. It's useful for engineers, designers, and especially your customers if there isn't a random color for each button in your app.

## 🚀 Get started

Mirrorful is a NPM package intended to be installed as dev dependency.

```bash
npm install mirrorful -D
```

or

```bash
yarn add mirrorful -D
```

## ✨ Usage

The following command will start a local editor at `localhost:5050`.

```
npx mirrorful
```

or

```
yarn run mirrorful
```

## 📚 Documentation

Check out our [documentation](https://mirrorful.com/docs) for more information.

## 🤝 Component Library Agnostic

We strive to be component library agnostic. Whether you're using Material UI, Chakra UI, Tailwind, Ant Design, or even your in-house library, Mirrorful hooks right in.

⚠️ `create-react-app` may warn that you are trying to import from outside the `src` directory. We are working on a long-term solution, but for now, we would recommend making a copy of the `.mirrorful` folder in your `src` directory.

Check out our examples:

- [Mirrorful 🤝 Tailwind CSS (and Next)](https://github.com/Mirrorful/mirrorful/tree/main/examples/tailwind-next)
- [Mirrorful 🤝 Chakra UI](https://github.com/Mirrorful/mirrorful/tree/main/examples/with-chakra-ui)
- [Mirrorful 🤝 Basic Create React App](https://github.com/Mirrorful/mirrorful/tree/main/examples/create-react-app)
- [Mirrorful 🤝 Basic Nuxt 3 App](https://github.com/Mirrorful/mirrorful/tree/main/examples/nuxt-3)
- [Mirrorful 🤝 Bootstrap (and Next)](https://github.com/Mirrorful/mirrorful/tree/main/examples/bootstrap-next)
- [Mirrorful 🤝 styled-components](https://github.com/Mirrorful/mirrorful/tree/main/examples/with-styled-components)
