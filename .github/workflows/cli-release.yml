# This file is practically a copy/paste from the goreleaser docs.
# Goreleaser has created an action specifically for Github actions
# and you can see the full instructions here:
# https://goreleaser.com/ci/actions/?h=github+ac.
# I have made just a couple of modifications to this for my needs.
#
# First, I modified the on section at the top of the file which tells Github actions to
# activate this action when a tag is pushed to this project. Second,
# I modified the version value so it sets the version number to the tag I created.
# Finally, I changed the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable value to
# ${{ secrets.PUBLISHER_TOKEN }}
